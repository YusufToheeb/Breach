        <h1>Welcome To the mirror Beach</h1>
        <p>A beach is a narrow, gently sloping strip of land that lies along the edge of an ocean, lake, or river.
            Materials such as sand, pebbles, rocks, and seashell fragments cover beaches. Most beach materials are the
            products of weathering and erosion. Over many years, water and wind wear away at the land</p>

        <p>Though some beaches form on freshwater locations, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current
            action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural
            processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be
            backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. However, these natural forces
            have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some
            estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to
            climate-change driven sea level rise.[2]

            Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines.[2] These beaches are popular for recreation,
            playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. To support these uses,
            some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and
            bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or
            housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents.

        <p>Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices
            on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal
            erosion from sea level rise and climate change. Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve
            or restore natural beach processes, while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach
            nourishment.

            Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or
            recreation. Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity,
            such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins. Preserved beaches
            and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human
            infrastructure.</p>

                There are several conspicuous parts to a beach that relate to the processes that form and shape it. The
                part
                mostly above water (depending upon tide), and more or less actively influenced by the waves at some
                point in
                the tide, is termed the beach berm. The berm is the deposit of material comprising the active shoreline!

            <p>
                The berm has a crest (top) and a face—the latter being the slope leading down towards the water from the
                crest. At the very bottom of the face, there may be a trough, and further seaward one or more long shore
                bars: slightly raised, underwater embankments formed where the waves first start to break.!

                The sand deposit may extend well inland from the berm crest, where there may be evidence of one or more
                older crests (the storm beach) resulting from very large storm waves and beyond the influence of the
                normal
                waves. At some point the influence of the waves (even storm waves) on the material comprising the beach
                stops, and if the particles are small enough (sand size or smaller), winds shape the feature.!
